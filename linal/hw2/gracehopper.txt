Last week, I attended Grace Hopper, a conference celebrating women in computing. One of the panels that stuck out to me the most was on encouraging middle, high schools and college girls to continue in computing and engineering.

Most of the panelists touched on initiatives similar to ones that I ran in college. Summer camps, afterschool activities, tours around labs.
